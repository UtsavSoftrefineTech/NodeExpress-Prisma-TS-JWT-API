# NodeExpress API with Prisma ORM and JWT Authentication

Welcome to the NodeExpress API project, a powerful and efficient solution for building RESTful APIs using Node.js, Express, Prisma ORM, and JWT Authentication. This project is designed to help you create a robust API for an imaginary ChangeLog app, allowing product managers and engineers to post and manage product updates seamlessly.

## Project Overview

### Description

Design and build APIs from the ground up in Node.js! Use Express to handle routes and create your REST API. You'll read and update data from a Postgres database using Prisma and TypeScript. Additionally, enhance the security of your API by implementing JWT authentication.

### Database Schema Design

We have carefully crafted a database schema to support the functionalities of our ChangeLog app. The schema includes models such as `Update`, `Update Point`, `Feature`, and standard user information.

### Why This Project?

We aim to create a reliable and scalable API to serve as the backend for our ChangeLog app. While we won't be building a UI in this project, the API is designed to handle essential operations such as reading, creating, updating, and deleting product updates.

## Tools Used

### Runtime
- Node.js: A runtime that leverages JavaScript, providing a rich and active ecosystem.

### Framework
- Express: A powerful web application framework for Node.js, making API development efficient and organized.

### Prisma
- Prisma ORM: A tool for designing the database according to our needs, handling schemas, queries, and migrations.

### Database
- PostgreSQL: A robust and popular database, chosen for its versatility. Prisma interacts with Postgres seamlessly.

### Hosting
- Render: A platform that simplifies the hosting of Node.js-based APIs, providing ease of deployment.
